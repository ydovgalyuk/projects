**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xTaskCreate (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**         Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are
**         ready to run.
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         pvTaskCode      - Pointer to the task entry
**                           function. Tasks must be implemented to
**                           never return (i.e. continuous loop).
**         pcName          - A descriptive name for the task.
**                           This is mainly used to facilitate debugging.
**                           Max length defined by
**                           configMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN.
**         usStackDepth    - The size of the task
**                           stack specified as the number of variables
**                           the stack can hold - not the number of
**                           bytes. For example, if the stack is 16 bits
**                           wide and usStackDepth is defined as 100,
**                           200 bytes will be allocated for stack
**                           storage. The stack depth multiplied by the
**                           stack width must not exceed the maximum
**                           value that can be contained in a variable
**                           of type size_t.
**         pvParameters    - Pointer that will be
**                           used as the parameter for the task being
**                           created.
**         uxPriority      - The priority at which the
**                           task should run.
**         pvCreatedTask   - Used to pass back a
**                           handle by which the created task can be
**                           referenced.
**     Returns     :
**         ---             - pdPASS if the task was successfully
**                           created and added to a ready list,

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_vTaskDelay (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**         Delay a task for a given number of ticks. The actual time
**         that the task remains blocked depends on the tick rate. The
**         constant portTICK_RATE_MS can be used to calculate real time
**         from the tick rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
**         vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to
**         unblock relative to the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.
**         For example, specifying a block period of 100 ticks will
**         cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after vTaskDelay() is
**         called. vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good
**         method of controlling the frequency of a cyclical task as
**         the path taken through the code, as well as other task and
**         interrupt activity, will effect the frequency at which
**         vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the
**         task next executes. See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative
**         API function designed to facilitate fixed frequency
**         execution. It does this by specifying an absolute time
**         (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task
**         should unblock. 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xTicksToDelay   - The amount of time, in
**                           tick periods, that the calling task should

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_vTaskDelayUntil (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**         Delay a task until a specified time. This function can be
**         used by cyclical tasks to ensure a constant execution
**         frequency.
**         This function differs from vTaskDelay() in one important
**         aspect: vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task
**         wishes to unblock relative to the time at which vTaskDelay()
**         is called, whereas vTaskDelayUntil() specifies an absolute
**         time at which the task wishes to unblock.
**         vTaskDelay() will cause a task to block for the specified
**         number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay() is called. It is
**         therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay() by itself to
**         generate a fixed execution frequency as the time between a
**         task unblocking following a call to vTaskDelay() and that
**         task next calling vTaskDelay() may not be fixed [the task
**         may take a different path though the code between calls, or
**         may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
**         each time it executes].
**         Whereas vTaskDelay() specifies a wake time relative to the
**         time at which the function is called, vTaskDelayUntil()
**         specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
**         unblock.
**         It should be noted that vTaskDelayUntil() will return
**         immediately (without blocking) if it is used to specify a
**         wake time that is already in the past. Therefore a task
**         using vTaskDelayUntil() to execute periodically will have to
**         re-calculate its required wake time if the periodic
**         execution is halted for any reason (for example, the task is
**         temporarily placed into the Suspended state) causing the
**         task to miss one or more periodic executions. This can be
**         detected by checking the variable passed by reference as the
**         pxPreviousWakeTime parameter against the current tick count.
**         This is however not necessary under most usage scenarios.
**         The constant portTICK_RATE_MS can be used to calculate real
**         time from the tick rate - with the resolution of one tick
**         period.
**         This function must not be called while the scheduler has
**         been suspended by a call to vTaskSuspendAll(). 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         pxPreviousWakeTime - Pointer to a
**                           variable that holds the time at which the
**                           task was last unblocked. The variable must
**                           be initialised with the current time prior
**                           to its first use (see the example below).
**                           Following this the variable is
**                           automatically updated within
**                           vTaskDelayUntil().

**                           (*pxPreviousWakeTime + xTimeIncrement).
**                           Calling vTaskDelayUntil with the same
**                           xTimeIncrement parameter value will cause

**     Description :
**         Macro that creates a mutex semaphore by using the existing
**         queue mechanism.
**         Mutexes created using this macro can be accessed using the
**         xSemaphoreTake() and xSemaphoreGive() macros. The
**         xSemaphoreTakeRecursive() and xSemaphoreGiveRecursive()
**         macros should not be used.
**         Mutexes and binary semaphores are very similar but have some
**         subtle differences: Mutexes include a priority inheritance
**         mechanism, binary semaphores do not. This makes binary
**         semaphores the better choice for implementing
**         synchronisation (between tasks or between tasks and an
**         interrupt), and mutexes the better choice for implementing
**         simple mutual exclusion.
**         The priority of a task that 'takes' a mutex can potentially
**         be raised if another task of higher priority attempts to
**         obtain the same mutex. The task that owns the mutex
**         'inherits' the priority of the task attempting to 'take' the
**         same mutex. This means the mutex must always be 'given' back
**         - otherwise the higher priority task will never be able to
**         obtain the mutex, and the lower priority task will never
**         'disinherit' the priority. An example of a mutex being used
**         to implement mutual exclusion is provided on the
**         xSemaphoreTake() documentation page.
**         A binary semaphore need not be given back once obtained, so
**         task synchronisation can be implemented by one
**         task/interrupt continuously 'giving' the semaphore while
**         another continuously 'takes' the semaphore. This is
**         demonstrated by the sample code on the
**         xSemaphoreGiveFromISR() documentation page.
**         Both mutex and binary semaphores are assigned to variables
**         of type xSemaphoreHandle and can be used in any API function
**         that takes a parameter of this type. 
**     Parameters  : None
**     Returns     :

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_vSemaphoreCreateBinary (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**         Macro that creates a semaphore by using the existing queue
**         mechanism. The queue length is 1 as this is a binary
**         semaphore. The data size is 0 as we don't want to actually
**         store any data - we just want to know if the queue is empty
**         or full.
**         Binary semaphores and mutexes are very similar but have some
**         subtle differences: Mutexes include a priority inheritance
**         mechanism, binary semaphores do not. This makes binary
**         semaphores the better choice for implementing
**         synchronisation (between tasks or between tasks and an
**         interrupt), and mutexes the better choice for implementing
**         simple mutual exclusion.
**         This old vSemaphoreCreateBinary() macro is now deprecated in
**         favour of the xSemaphoreCreateBinary() function.  Note that
**         binary semaphores created using the vSemaphoreCreateBinary()
**         macro are created in a state such that the first call to
**         'take' the semaphore would pass, whereas binary semaphores
**         created using xSemaphoreCreateBinary() are created in a
**         state such that the the semaphore must first be 'given'
**         before it can be 'taken'.
**         A binary semaphore need not be given back once obtained, so
**         task synchronisation can be implemented by one
**         task/interrupt continuously 'giving' the semaphore while
**         another continuously 'takes' the semaphore. This is
**         demonstrated by the sample code on the
**         xSemaphoreGiveFromISR() documentation page.
**         The priority of a task that 'takes' a mutex can potentially
**         be raised if another task of higher priority attempts to
**         obtain the same mutex. The task that owns the mutex
**         'inherits' the priority of the task attempting to 'take' the
**         same mutex. This means the mutex must always be 'given' back
**         - otherwise the higher priority task will never be able to
**         obtain the mutex, and the lower priority task will never
**         'disinherit' the priority. An example of a mutex being used
**         to implement mutual exclusion is provided on the
**         xSemaphoreTake() documentation page.
**         Both mutex and binary semaphores are assigned to variables
**         of type xSemaphoreHandle and can be used in any API function
**         that takes a parameter of this type. 
**     Parameters  :

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xSemaphoreCreateCounting (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**         Macro that creates a counting semaphore by using the
**         existing queue mechanism.
**         Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:
**         1. Counting events.
**         In this usage scenario an event handler will 'give' a
**         semaphore each time an event occurs (incrementing the
**         semaphore count value), and a handler task will 'take' a
**         semaphore each time it processes an event (decrementing the
**         semaphore count value). The count value is therefore the
**         difference between the number of events that have occurred
**         and the number that have been processed. In this case it is
**         desirable for the initial count value to be zero.
**         2. Resource management.
**         In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number
**         of resources available. To obtain control of a resource a
**         task must first obtain a semaphore - decrementing the
**         semaphore count value. When the count value reaches zero
**         there are no free resources. When a task finishes with the
**         resource it 'gives' the semaphore back - incrementing the
**         semaphore count value. In this case it is desirable for the
**         initial count value to be equal to the maximum count value,
**         indicating that all resources are free.
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         uxMaxCount      - The maximum count value that
**                           can be reached. When the semaphore reaches
**                           this value it can no longer be 'given'.
**         uxInitialCount  - The count value
**                           assigned to the semaphore when it is
**                           created.

**         This macro can be used from an ISR, however taking a

**         likely to only be useful when taking a counting semaphore
**         when an interrupt is obtaining an object from a resource
**         pool (when the semaphore count indicates the number of

**     Description :
**          Create a new RTOS event group. This function cannot be

**         configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS is set to 0. The dependency on

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xEventGroupWaitBits (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**          Read bits within an RTOS event group, optionally entering
**         the Blocked state (with a timeout) to wait for a bit or
**         group of bits to become set. This function cannot be called
**         from an interrupt. 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xEventGroup     - The event group in which
**                           the bits are being tested. The event group
**                           must have previously been created using a
**                           call to xEventGroupCreate(). 
**         uxBitsToWaitFor - A bitwise value
**                           that indicates the bit or bits to test
**                           inside the event group. For example, to
**                           wait for bit 0 and/or bit 2 set
**                           uxBitsToWaitFor to 0x05. To wait for bits 0
**                           and/or bit 1 and/or bit 2 set
**                           uxBitsToWaitFor to 0x07. Etc.
**                           uxBitsToWaitFor must not be set to 0. 
**         xClearOnExit    - If xClearOnExit is set
**                           to pdTRUE then any bits set in the value
**                           passed as the uxBitsToWaitFor parameter
**                           will be cleared in the event group before
**                           xEventGroupWaitBits() returns if

**                           reason other than a timeout. The timeout
**                           value is set by the xTicksToWait parameter.
**                           If xClearOnExit is set to pdFALSE then the
**                           bits set in the event group are not altered
**                           when the call to xEventGroupWaitBits()
**                           returns. 
**         xWaitForAllBits - xWaitForAllBits is
**                           used to create either a logical AND test
**                           (where all bits must be set) or a logical
**                           OR test (where one or more bits must be set)
**                           as follows:
**                           If xWaitForAllBits is set to pdTRUE then
**                           xEventGroupWaitBits() will return when
**                           either all the bits set in the value passed
**                           as the uxBitsToWaitFor parameter are set in

**                           expires. 
**         xTicksToWait    - The maximum amount of
**                           time (specified in 'ticks') to wait for
**                           one/all (depending on the xWaitForAllBits

**                           uxBitsToWaitFor to become set. 
**     Returns     :
**         ---             - EventBits_t: The value of the event group
**                           at the time either the event bits being
**                           waited for became set, or the block time
**                           expired. The current value of the event
**                           bits in an event group will be different to
**                           the returned value if a higher priority
**                           task or interrupt changed the value of an
**                           event bit between the calling task leaving
**                           the Blocked state and exiting the

**                           Test the return value to know which bits
**                           were set. If xEventGroupWaitBits() returned
**                           because its timeout expired then not all
**                           the bits being waited for will be set. If

**         Setting bits in an event group will automatically unblock

**         Setting bits in an event group is not a deterministic

**         xEventGroup     - The event group in which

**                           must have previously been created using a

**                           event group. For example, set uxBitsToSet
**                           to 0x08 to set only bit 3. Set uxBitsToSet
**                           to 0x09 to set bit 3 and bit 0.

**                           There are two reasons why the returned

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xTimerCreate (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**          Creates a new software timer instance. This allocates the

**         xTimerPeriod    - The timer period. The
**                           time is defined in tick periods so the
**                           constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to
**                           convert a time that has been specified in
**                           milliseconds. For example, if the timer
**                           must expire after 100 ticks, then
**                           xTimerPeriod should be set to 100.
**                           Alternatively, if the timer must expire
**                           after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set to (
**                           500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS ) provided
**                           configTICK_RATE_HZ is less than or equal to
**                           1000. 
**         uxAutoReload    - If uxAutoReload is set
**                           to pdTRUE, then the timer will expire
**                           repeatedly with a frequency set by the
**                           xTimerPeriod parameter. If uxAutoReload is
**                           set to pdFALSE, then the timer will be a
**                           one-shot and enter the dormant state after
**                           it expires. 
**         pvTimerID       - An identifier that is assigned
**                           to the timer being created. Typically this
**                           would be used in the timer callback
**                           function to identify which timer expired
**                           when the same callback function is assigned
**                           to more than one timer. 
**         pxCallbackFunction - The function
**                           to call when the timer expires. Callback
**                           functions must have the prototype defined
**                           by TimerCallbackFunction_t, which is "void

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xTimerStart (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**          Timer functionality is provided by a timer service/daemon
**         task. Many of the public FreeRTOS timer API functions send
**         commands to the timer service task through a queue called
**         the timer command queue. The timer command queue is private
**         to the RTOS kernel itself and is not directly accessible to
**         application code. The length of the timer command queue is
**         set by the configTIMER_QUEUE_LENGTH configuration constant.
**         xTimerStart() starts a timer that was previously created
**         using the xTimerCreate() API function. If the timer had
**         already been started and was already in the active state,
**         then xTimerStart() has equivalent functionality to the
**         xTimerReset() API function.
**         Starting a timer ensures the timer is in the active state.
**         If the timer is not stopped, deleted, or reset in the mean
**         time, the callback function associated with the timer will
**         get called 'n 'ticks after xTimerStart() was called, where
**         'n' is the timers defined period.
**         It is valid to call xTimerStart() before the RTOS scheduler
**         has been started, but when this is done the timer will not
**         actually start until the RTOS scheduler is started, and the
**         timers expiry time will be relative to when the RTOS
**         scheduler is started, not relative to when xTimerStart() was
**         called.
**         The configUSE_TIMERS configuration constant must be set to 1
**         for xTimerStart() to be available. 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xTimer          - The handle of the timer being
**                           started/restarted. 
**         xBlockTime      - Specifies the time, in ticks,
**                           that the calling task should be held in the
**                           Blocked state to wait for the start command

**                           full when xTimerStart() was called.
**                           xBlockTime is ignored if xTimerStart() is
**                           called before the RTOS scheduler is started.
**     Returns     :
**         ---             - pdFAIL will be returned if the start
**                           command could not be sent to the timer
**                           command queue even after xBlockTime ticks

**     Description :
**          Timer functionality is provided by a timer service/daemon
**         task. Many of the public FreeRTOS timer API functions send
**         commands to the timer service task through a queue called
**         the timer command queue. The timer command queue is private

**         application code. The length of the timer command queue is
**         set by the configTIMER_QUEUE_LENGTH configuration constant.
**         xTimerChangePeriod() changes the period of a timer that was
**         previously created using the xTimerCreate() API function.
**         xTimerChangePeriod() can be called to change the period of
**         an active or dormant state timer.
**         The configUSE_TIMERS configuration constant must be set to 1
**         for xTimerChangePeriod() to be available. 
**     Parameters  :

**                           Timer periods are specified in tick periods,
**                           so the constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be
**                           used to convert a time that has been
**                           specified in milliseconds. For example, if
**                           the timer must expire after 100 ticks, then
**                           xNewPeriod should be set to 100.
**                           Alternatively, if the timer must expire
**                           after 500ms, then xNewPeriod can be set to
**                           ( 500 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS ) provided

**         xTimerReset() re-starts a timer that was previously created
**         using the xTimerCreate() API function. If the timer had
**         already been started and was already in the active state,
**         then xTimerReset() will cause the timer to re-evaluate its
**         expiry time so that it is relative to when xTimerReset() was
**         called. If the timer was in the dormant state then
**         xTimerReset() has equivalent functionality to the

**         Resetting a timer ensures the timer is in the active state.
**         If the timer is not stopped, deleted, or reset in the mean

**         get called 'n' ticks after xTimerReset() was called, where
**         'n' is the timers defined period.
**         It is valid to call xTimerReset() before the RTOS scheduler
**         has been started, but when this is done the timer will not
**         actually start until the RTOS scheduler is started, and the
**         timers expiry time will be relative to when the RTOS

**                           xNewPeriod should be set to 100.

**         timer service task, hence this function is implemented in
**         timers.c and is prefixed with 'Timer').
**         Ideally an interrupt service routine (ISR) is kept as short
**         as possible, but sometimes an ISR either has a lot of
**         processing to do, or needs to perform processing that is not
**         deterministic. In these cases xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR()
**         can be used to defer processing of a function to the RTOS
**         daemon task.
**         A mechanism is provided that allows the interrupt to return
**         directly to the task that will subsequently execute the
**         pended function. This allows the callback function to
**         execute contiguously in time with the interrupt - just as if
**         the callback had executed in the interrupt itself.
**         Functions that can be deferred to the RTOS daemon task must

**         void vPendableFunction( void * pvParameter1, uint32_t

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_ulTaskNotifyTake (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**          Each RTOS task has a 32-bit notification value which is
**         initialised to zero when the RTOS task is created. An RTOS
**         task notification is an event sent directly to a task that
**         can unblock the receiving task, and optionally update the
**         receiving task's notification value.
**         ulTaskNotifyTake() is intended for use when a task
**         notification is used as a faster and lighter weight binary
**         or counting semaphore alternative. FreeRTOS semaphores are
**         taken using the xSemaphoreTake() API function,
**         ulTaskNotifyTake() is the equivalent that instead uses a
**         task notification.
**         When a task is using its notification value as a binary or
**         counting semaphore other tasks and interrupts should send
**         notifications to it using either the xTaskNotifyGive() macro,
**         or the xTaskNotify() function with the function's eAction
**         parameter set to eIncrement (the two are equivalent).
**         ulTaskNotifyTake() can either clear the task's notification
**         value to zero on exit, in which case the notification value
**         acts like a binary semaphore, or decrement the task's
**         notification value on exit, in which case the notification
**         value acts more like a counting semaphore.
**         An RTOS task can use ulTaskNotifyTake() to [optionally]
**         block to wait for a the task's notification value to be
**         non-zero. The task does not consume any CPU time while it is
**         in the Blocked state.
**         Where as xTaskNotifyWait() will return when a notification
**         is pending, ulTaskNotifyTake() will return when the task's
**         notification value is not zero, decrementing the task's
**         notification value before it returns. 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xClearCountOnExit - If an RTOS
**                           task notification is received and
**                           xClearCountOnExit is set to pdFALSE then
**                           the RTOS task's notification value is
**                           decremented before ulTaskNotifyTake() exits.
**                           This is equivalent to the value of a
**                           counting semaphore being decremented by a
**                           successful call to xSemaphoreTake().
**                           If an RTOS task notification is received
**                           and xClearCountOnExit is set to pdTRUE then
**                           the RTOS task's notification value is reset
**                           to 0 before ulTaskNotifyTake() exits. This
**                           is equivalent to the value of a binary
**                           semaphore being left at zero (or empty, or
**                           'not available') after a successful call to
**                           xSemaphoreTake(). 
**         xTicksToWait    - The maximum time to wait

**         ulValue         - Used to update the notification

**                           description of the eAction parameter below. 
**         eAction         - An enumerated type that can take

**                           event, but its notification value is not
**                           updated. In this case ulValue is not used.
**                           - eSetBits: 	The notification value of the
**                           subject task will be bitwise ORed with
**                           ulValue. For example, if ulValue is set to
**                           0x01, then bit 0 will get set within the
**                           subject task's notification value. Likewise
**                           if ulValue is 0x04 then bit 2 will get set

**                           making the call to xTaskNotify() equivalent

**                           - eSetValueWithoutOverwrite: 	If the
**                           subject task does not already have a
**                           notification pending then its notification
**                           value will be set to ulValue. If the

**                           RTOS task handles are obtained using the
**                           pvCreatedTask parameter of the xTaskCreate()
**                           call used to create the task.

**                           task is returned by the
**                           xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle() API function. 
**         ulValue         - Used to update the notification
**                           value of the subject task. See the
**                           description of the eAction parameter below. 
**         eAction         - An enumerated type that can take
**                           one of the values documented in the table
**                           below in order to perform the associated
**                           action. 
**                           - eNoAction: 	The subject task receives the
**                           event, but its notification value is not
**                           updated. In this case ulValue is not used.
**                           - eSetBits: 	The notification value of the
**                           subject task will be bitwise ORed with
**                           ulValue. For example, if ulValue is set to
**                           0x01, then bit 0 will get set within the
**                           subject task's notification value. Likewise
**                           if ulValue is 0x04 then bit 2 will get set
**                           in the subject task's notification value.
**                           In this way the RTOS task notification
**                           mechanism can be used as a light weight
**                           alternative to an event group.
**                           - eIncrement: 	The notification value of
**                           the subject task will be incremented by one,
**                           making the call to xTaskNotify() equivalent
**                           to a call to xTaskNotifyGive(). In this
**                           case ulValue is not used.
**                           - eSetValueWithOverwrite: 	The notification
**                           value of the subject task is
**                           unconditionally set to ulValue. In this way
**                           the RTOS task notification mechanism is
**                           being used as a light weight alternative to
**                           xQueueOverwrite().
**                           - eSetValueWithoutOverwrite: 	If the
**                           subject task does not already have a
**                           notification pending then its notification
**                           value will be set to ulValue. If the
**                           subject task already has a notification
**                           pending then its notification value is not
**                           updated as to do so would overwrite the
**                           previous value before it was used. In this
**                           case the call to xTaskNotify() fails and
**                           pdFALSE is returned. In this way the RTOS
**                           task notification mechanism is being used
**                           as a light weight alternative to
**                           xQueueSend() on a queue of length 1. 
**       * pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken 
**                           - *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be
**                           initialised to 0.
**                           xTaskNotifyFromISR() will set
**                           *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken to pdTRUE if
**                           sending the notification caused a task to
**                           unblock, and the unblocked task has a
**                           priority higher than the currently running
**                           task.
**                           If xTaskNotifyFromISR() sets this value to
**                           pdTRUE then a context switch should be
**                           requested before the interrupt is exited.
**                           See the example below.
**                           pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken is an optional
**                           parameter and can be set to NULL. 
**     Returns     :

**         Each RTOS task has a 32-bit notification value which is
**         initialised to zero when the RTOS task is created. An RTOS
**         task notification is an event sent directly to a task that
**         can unblock the receiving task, and optionally update the
**         receiving task's notification value in a number of different
**         ways. For example, a notification may overwrite the
**         receiving task's notification value, or just set one or more
**         bits in the receiving task's notification value. See the
**         RTOS task notifications use case documentation for examples.
**         xTaskNotifyWait() waits, with an optional timeout, for the

**         If the receiving RTOS task was already Blocked waiting for a

**         ulBitsToClearOnEntry - Any bits
**                           set in ulBitsToClearOnEntry will be cleared

**                           is called.
**                           For example, if ulBitsToClearOnEntry is
**                           0x01, then bit 0 of the task's notification

**                           function.
**                           Setting ulBitsToClearOnEntry to 0xffffffff
**                           (ULONG_MAX) will clear all the bits in the

**                           exits if a notification was received.
**                           The bits are cleared after the RTOS task's

**     Description :
**         The old vSemaphoreCreateBinary() macro is now deprecated in
**         favour of this xSemaphoreCreateBinary() function.  Note that
**         binary semaphores created using the vSemaphoreCreateBinary()
**         macro are created in a state such that the first call to
**         'take' the semaphore would pass, whereas binary semaphores
**         created using xSemaphoreCreateBinary() are created in a
**         state such that the the semaphore must first be 'given'
**         before it can be 'taken'.
**         Function that creates a semaphore by using the existing
**         queue mechanism. The queue length is 1 as this is a binary
**         semaphore.  The data size is 0 as nothing is actually stored
**         - all that is important is whether the queue is empty or
**         full (the binary semaphore is available or not).
**         This type of semaphore can be used for pure synchronisation
**         between tasks or between an interrupt and a task.  The
**         semaphore need not be given back once obtained, so one
**         task/interrupt can continuously 'give' the semaphore while
**         another continuously 'takes' the semaphore.  For this reason
**         this type of semaphore does not use a priority inheritance
**         mechanism.  For an alternative that does use priority
**         inheritance see xSemaphoreCreateMutex().

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xTaskNotifyAndQueryFromISR (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**          [If you are using RTOS task notifications to implement
**         binary or counting semaphore type behaviour then use the
**         simpler xTaskNotifyGive() API function instead of
**         xTaskNotify()]
**         Each RTOS task has a 32-bit notification value which is
**         initialised to zero when the RTOS task is created.
**         xTaskNotify() is used to send an event directly to and
**         potentially unblock an RTOS task, and optionally update the
**         receiving task's notification value in one of the following
**         ways:
**         - Write a 32-bit number to the notification value
**         - Add one (increment) the notification value
**         - Set one or more bits in the notification value
**         - Leave the notification value unchanged
**         This function must not be called from an interrupt service
**         routine (ISR). Use xTaskNotifyFromISR() instead. 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xTaskToNotify   - The handle of the RTOS
**                           task being notified. This is the subject
**                           task.
**                           RTOS task handles are obtained using the
**                           pvCreatedTask parameter of the xTaskCreate()
**                           call used to create the task.
**                           The handle of the currently executing RTOS
**                           task is returned by the
**                           xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle() API function. 
**         ulValue         - Used to update the notification
**                           value of the subject task. See the
**                           description of the eAction parameter below. 
**         eAction         - An enumerated type that can take
**                           one of the values documented in the table
**                           below in order to perform the associated
**                           action. 
**       * pulPreviousNotifyValue - Can
**                           be used to pass out the subject task's
**                           notification value before any bits are
**                           modified by the action of
**                           xTaskNotifyAndQuery().
**                           pulPreviousNotifyValue is an optional
**                           parameter, and can be set to NULL if it is
**                           not required. If pulPreviousNotifyValue is
**                           not used then consider using xTaskNotify()
**                           in place of xTaskNotifyAndQuery(). 
**       * pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken 
**                           - *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must be
**                           initialised to 0.
**                           xTaskNotifyFromISR() will set
**                           *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken to pdTRUE if
**                           sending the notification caused a task to
**                           unblock, and the unblocked task has a
**                           priority higher than the currently running
**                           task.
**                           If xTaskNotifyFromISR() sets this value to
**                           pdTRUE then a context switch should be
**                           requested before the interrupt is exited.
**                           See the example below.
**                           pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken is an optional
**                           parameter and can be set to NULL. 
**     Returns     :
**         ---             - pdPASS is returned in all cases other than
**                           when eAction is set to

**                           task's notification value cannot be updated
**                           because the subject task already had a
